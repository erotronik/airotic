# Printing and assembling the bottle
## Parts list:
* The STL files for the cap, cover, spigot and LED covers
* A [RYACO 800ml wide mouth bottle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088B7RL98/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_RTAABATTSC8DW0E9HZ2Y)
* The seal from the lid of the RYACO bottle
* A short length of 6mm tubing
* Some superglue or similar adhesive

## Construction
### Step 1
* Slice the STL files to suit your 3D printer
* We sliced in Cura at a 0.2mm layer height with supports and 20% infill
### Step 2
* Print your parts 
* We printed in both PLA and PETG for the cap, cover and spigots
* You will need to use transparent filament for the LED caps
### Step 3
* Remove support materials (if you needed supports on the cap, be gentle around the vents)
* Check that the cap fits the bottle properly before proceeding
### Step 4
* On the underside of the cap, superglue the spigot into the hole and leave to set
### Step 5
* Sand, paint or finish to your own taste
* We suggest not altering the area of the cap where the electronics will go to avoid changing the fit
* You can remove the logo on the bottle with a sharp blade by carefully scraping the letters off.
### Step 6
* Remove the seal from the RYACO bottle lid and insert it into the channel on the cap's underside
### Step 7
* Proceed to assembling the electronics before attaching the tube to the spigot for ease of handling.
